The Can gene of E.coli encodes for carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme that assists rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, protons, and bicarbonate ions. E.coli requires a constant supply of bicarbonate as a metabolic substrate during normal growth. So, if this gene is knocked out, E. coli is unable to turn the carbon dioxide into bicarbonate fast enough before the carbon dioxide diffuses out and causes cell death. Inside the gut, where we want the E.coli to survive, the carbon dioxide concentration is high enough (ranging from 5% to 29%) to allow the spontaneous conversion of carbon dioxide into bicarbonate ions.

Production chassis will incorporate a blue-light inducible flocculation gene circuit that will result in the chassis flocculating to the bottom of the reactor vessel. Only the cell-free supernatant will be siphoned off from the top to prevent uptake of the chassis. Secondary biocontainment is achieved using a blue and red light-inducible AND gate that will trigger the expression of endonucleases to destroy any chassis organisms that were not flocculated. tertiary biocontainment is achieved through filtering Product from the reactor through a 0.22-micrometer membrane to prevent any remaining chassis organism from being retained in the final product

In the unlikely event of accidental release of the chassis, horizontal gene transfer of hygromycin resistance may occur. Chassis itself is not pathogenic in nature and is an auxotrophic species. Essentially it is unlikely to survive in the environment without proper nutrient supplementation.

This could potentially mitigate the issues of coral bleaching seen along the Australian coasts and the eventual decline of coral health and its population. However, if our project were to be fully developed into this, safety, security, and ethical risks must be considered before introducing them into the environment. Therefore, incorporating a kill switch will be an essential precaution for releasing X into the environment. 
Our kill switch will utilise the natural mechanism by which Symbiodinium associates with its coral hosts to activate a toxin/antitoxin system. The interaction of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) on Symbiodinium with the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the corals facilitates the endocytosis of the microalgae by the coral tissue. The microalgae then reside within the coral polyp tissue in a symbiosome vacuole through constant cell surface interaction, separated from the rest of the coral cytoplasm. When the microalgae are expelled from the coral, the MAMP/PRR interaction is lost. Our kill switch will use this described mechanism to activate a toxin/antitoxin system. The toxin will be constitutively produced under a weak promoter, allowing Symbiodinium to survive for some time, even when detached from a coral host. However, if the Symbiodinium is dissociated with the coral cells for a more extended period, the toxin build-up will cause cellular death and degradation. MAMP/PRR interaction will activate an inducible promoter to produce an anti-toxin when associated with the coral. The anti-toxin will neutralise the toxin and allow the Symbiodinium to continue regular nutrient exchange with the coral cell.",Improve thermotolerance and antioxidant capacities of Symbiodinium goreaui (S. goreaui)

IOANNINA,Europe,Agriculture,Yes,Partially Contained,NEI,Physical containment,"Our proposal for a possible application of our system is for it to be dried and sprayed to poultry manure right after it is collected and before the procedure of composting. As this would be a live bacterial organism that would contain genetically modified regions, we tried to make necessary changes to our initial thought to make it as safe as possible and to reduce the possibility of gene transfer in the environment. First of all, our final proposal is for it to be used in a contained, enclosed environment to reduce the possibilities of it escaping to the surrounding environment. As this would not be enough to ensure that our organism will not spread to its environment, we decided to use a kill switch mechanism that would destroy our bacteria once it has fulfilled its role of inactivating antibiotics in its environment. Specifically, we partnered with iGEM IISERxTirupati and together decided to apply to our project their kill switch mechanism of mf-lon protease that controls the action of a bpDNase1 with an mf-lon tag. This system is controlled in our design by TetR and MphR, two repressors of transcription regulated by the presence or absence of tetracyclines and macrolides respectively. This system can act as a safety mechanism to prevent our bacteria from spreading after there is no antibiotics left in the environment. Moreover, as we are using two enzymes that deactivate antibiotics we thought of a solution to minimize the occurrence of horizontal gene transfer of these 2 genes that could give antibiotic resistance to other organisms. Our design involves the integration of these two genes in the bacterial chromosome of our strain, something that will make the transfer of the genes much less likely to occur than if they were inserted into a plasmid. In the same basis, we have also designed the integration of our death gene(bpdnase1) into the chromosome while the mf-lon gene(antitoxin) would be carried on a plasmid to ensure that if the bacteria loses the plasmid in its lifespan, it would be immediately self-destructed by the activation of bpDNase1.",help reduce the antibiotic residues in chicken manure.

Our fully developed project includes 2 products, a capsule containing bacteria for the detection of SCFAs and an engineered probiotic for production of SCFAs.

Capsule: The engineered bacteria will be contained from the capsule s borders. The capsule is not degradable and the bacteria do not come in contact with the human gut or the environment. After the capsule is excreted to stool, the bacteria will die from starvation because we have designed a ddapA strain that can not duplicate without dap and dies from starvation within 2 days.

Probiotic: The engineered probiotic will survive only in <<gut conditions>>. We will utilize the tryptophan existing in the gut for a kill-switch suppressed by tryptophan.

TU-Eindhoven,Europe,"Human body or food,Biosensor",Yes,NEI,No-contained,Killswitch,"It is of high importance to regulate when and where the GMOs are alive or not. To do so, a kill switch can be incorporated into the plasmid design. Kill switches are genetic circuits that, depending on the environmental conditions, selectively eliminate GMOs. In this way, it can be ensured that bacteria are only alive in a defined area, in our case the human gut and inside the pill, and cannot escape into the environment. Kill-switches can be based on several environmental conditions, e.g. pH and temperature.[1,2]  
To assess which kill switch suits our system best, we must first identify where we want our GMOs to function, and where we want them to die. We thought of the specific environmental conditions that are present inside the gut of IBD patients. The first thing we came up with was the high variety of pH levels inside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The pH in the terminal ileum and colon is in general higher than in other regions of the GI tract. Therefore, a pH-dependent kill switch was our first option. However, it was soon rejected as the pH levels vary a lot inside the colon of IBD patients. [3]
[5] Therefore, the oxygen-dependent kill switch is a potential candidate that can be incorporated into the plasmid design in future research. This kill switch reduces hazards by ensuring cell death once the bacteria are released into the outside world. Due to time restrictions, we were not able to do it ourselves.

Knowing that the gut microbiota largely consists of anaerobic bacteria, it was inferred our GMO should fit these oxygen-deprived conditions. Over 90% of the total number of bacteria constitute anaerobic bacteria. The anaerobic environment in the gut is essential to maintain bacterial growth and nutrition production.[4] As the environment is rich and the human gut sparse in oxygen, a kill switch dependent on the oxygen level might suit our project. We found an article in which the authors studied the cytochrome o and d oxidase gene expression in E.coli under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. It turned out that the organism was able to survive better under oxygen-deprived conditions, as is found in the human gut.[5] Therefore, the oxygen-dependent kill switch is a potential candidate that can be incorporated into the plasmid design in future research.

Wageningen_UR,Europe,Agriculture,Yes,Partially Contained,No-contained,Killswitch,"Safety is an integral aspect of our project that we are taking into account for the design of our microorganisms and biofilter. Our microorganisms should be present exclusively inside the biofilter. We will design our biofilter in such a way that the chance of genetically engineered microorganisms escaping the system is minimal. In addition, a safety circuit will be engineered in the monoculture, or methanotrophic organism in the co-culture, where high concentrations of methane repress the production of a toxin produced in the organism. Should the microorganism escape from the biofilter, it will find itself in an environment where the methane concentration is lower. In this case, the production of the toxin is no longer repressed, and toxin production will cause the death of the methanotroph. To prevent cell death during brief periods of low methane (such as when the cows are allowed to graze outside during summer), a quorum sensing-based safety circuit will also be incorporated to act as a time-delay. In this safety circuit, bacteria produce N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) that also repress toxin production, but also rapidly diffuses outside the cells. Inside the biofilter in high cell density conditions, AHL concentrations will be high enough to repress the toxin adequately. However, should the cell escape the biofilter, it will find itself in a low-cell density environment where the AHL concentration is low as well. As a result, toxin production will no longer be repressed, and the cell will be killed. Finally, in the co-culture, the ammoniatroph will be made fully dependent on the methanotroph by establishing amino-acid auxotrophy between the two organisms. Thus, should either or both organisms escape, death of one organism will also result in the death of the other organism. The combination of this three-part safety system, in addition to the careful design of the biofilter itself, will minimize the chance of our engineered organism(s) escaping and spreading through the environment.

It is purely mechanistic.The phagemid-level mcherry-targeting plasmid phiMINT has the F1 ori which allows it to be packaged into M13KO7 virions. This is a method of initial distribution, but it is a contained one: since the helper phage plasmid is completely separate from the phagemid, the newly infected cell receives no helper phage plasmid. This means that the infected cell cannot produce more infectious viral particles, and so cannot spread autonomously as a standard virus does. There is no spread after the initial infection dosage.The mobilizable-level mcherry-targeting plasmid phiMINTO has an Ori T which allows it to be spread through bacterial conjugation. Any conjugative donor cells (ie, DH5a F') that hold phiMINTO could pass it on to any conjugative recipient cells (ie, normal DH5a). However, this plasmid does not contain the necessary parts to confer conjugative ability; the transconjugant bacterium cannot further spread the plasmid.
